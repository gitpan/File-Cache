Revision history for File::Cache

0.13 2000-10-07-19-22
  - binmode is now used to avoid problems with setting/getting binary data
    from the cache (This change probably means that the segfault
    above is no longer a problem. However, it's still a good idea to use a
    canonical format in case processes on different platforms are accessing
    the same cache over NFS.)
  - Removed unreferenced subroutine _purge_all
  - Minor formatting changes
  - Internal subroutines get_user_path() and get_namespace_path(), are
    now prefixed by an underscore
  - Names of non-method subroutines are now all consistently uppercase
  - File::Cache::REDUCE_SIZE was coded as a method, but documented as
    an object-independent function. Fixed it, and made
    _choose_victim_file an object-independent function
  - Added POD documentation for get_namespace(), set_namespace(),
    get_max_size(), set_max_size(), get_cache_depth(), and
    set_cache_depth()
  - "cache entry" changed to "cache object" for consistency in
    terminology
  - Cache size reduction is now done, if necessary, when
    set_max_size() called 
  - Minor portability improvements
  - Improved error checking for REDUCE_SIZE
  - Added parameter checking to subroutines
  - Removed $sGET_STALE_ONLY and $sGET_FRESH_ONLY from @EXPORT_OK list
    (these are internal constants)
  - Internal subroutines get_username_path() and get_namespace_path()
    now build the path directly from the cache key, username, and
    namespace parameters. Internal subroutines set_username_path() and
    set_namespace_path() removed.
  - Improved directory verification so that it only happens when the
    cache key, user, or namespace change.
  - Modified some functions to return references instead of operating
    on reference parameters
  - Added cache metadata support (useful for checking that an existing
    cache is compatible with the current version of File::Cache)
  - Added $CACHE_OBJECT_VERSION, which describes the version of cache
    objects that the current version of File::Cache can work with.
  - Added support for choosing the persistence mechanism to be either
    Storable (the traditional and default mechanism) or Data::Dumper.
    (Data::Dumper is slower, but (1) is a standard Perl module, (2) is
    written entirely in Perl (no compilation difficulties), and (3)
    generates human-readable cache entries.)
  - minor formatting change to better fit 80 columns
  - changed _UNTAINT_STRING to take a untainted regex
  - added _UNTAINT_FILE_PATH to call _UNTAINT_STRING with the file path regex
  - Changed default cache key from $TMPDIR/File::Cache to $TMPDIR/FileCache on
    DOS/Windows platforms, since the former is illegal.
  - retroactively split version 0.13 from 0.12
  - Corrupted cache objects stored using Data::Dumper are automatically
    detected and removed from the cache
  - Cache_Description.pl was changed to .description 
  - .description files now use a proprietary format instead of Data::Dumper
  - changed test.pl to always quote the call to the subprocess
  - changed test/test_get.pl to strip quotes if needed
  - wrote _RECURSIVELY_REMOVE_DIRECTORY to avoid taint failures in File::Path
  - switched to finddepth() instead of find() in File::Find because finddepth()
    doesn't use Cwd, which in turn is not taint safe.
  - removed the unused _UNTAINT_CACHE_DESCRIPTION_CODE() and
    $sUNTAINTED_CACHE_DESCRIPTION_CODE_REGEX
  - updated the README to mention the cache upgrade issues
  - updated the CREDITS file
  - changed _WRITE_FILE to write to a temp file then rename to
    avoid corruption race (thanks Randal!)
  - better documentation for get, get_stale, and set (thanks Randal!)
  - added two tests for getting and setting blessed objects
  

0.12 2000-08-25-09-58 (not public)
  - fixed a typo in CHANGES
  - added a more generic taint check called _untaint_string, this
    is called everywhere tainting could occur

    directory (Bug ID 104869)
  - removed last TODO item
  - cache directories are now only created when needed (David Coppit
    <david@coppit.org>)
  - fixed the second test "21" in test.pl
  - switched to nfreeze() instead of freeze to avoid segfault (thanks
    David!)

0.07 2000-04-10-09-45
  - added support for the "cache_depth" option that enables
    subdirectories in the cache to increase performance when caching
    large numbers of objects
  - rewrote the _recursive_find_nearest_expiration and
    _recursive_find_latest_accessed routines to actually work recursively
    (needed to support cache_depth)

    cache (thanks to Jessica Mintz)
