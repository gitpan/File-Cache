- David Coppit <david@coppit.org> added: max_size, auto_purge,
  get_stale(), reduce_size(), username, and filemode, fixed a bug that
  prevented expired cache items from being unlinked by purge(), and
  added the get_creation_time() and get_expiration_time() routines. (a
  big thanks David!)

- Larry Moore <ljmoore@freespace.net>, a cpan tester, noticed that
  version 0.04 failed to compile on MacOS (thanks Larry!)

- Frey Kuo <frey@engineer.com> pointed out that the example in the
  README was rather buggy.  (thanks Frey!)

- Doug Steinwand <dsteinwand@etoys.com> found that on FreeBSD, the
  _purge routine failed due to an issue with File::Find and even
  provided a fix.  (thanks Doug!)

- Chris Winters <cwinters@intes.net> needed the cache_depth code, so I
  added it, and he was gracious enough to help test it

- Jessica Mintz provided valuable debugging information that tracked
  down the unlink file race

- Jeremy Howard (jhoward@fastmail.fm) added two great patches that
  made File::Cache taint safe, plus he's using it at fastmail.fm!
