- David Coppit <david@coppit.org> added: max_size, auto_purge, get_stale(),
  reduce_size(), username, and filemode, and fixed a bug that prevented
  expired cache items from being unlinked by purge(). (a big thanks David!)

- Larry Moore <ljmoore@freespace.net>, a cpan tester, noticed that version 0.04 
  failed to compile on MacOS (thanks Larry!)

- Frey Kuo <frey@engineer.com> pointed out that the example in the README was
  rather buggy.  (thanks Frey!)

- Doug Steinwand <dsteinwand@etoys.com> found that on FreeBSD, the _purge routine
  failed due to an issue with File::Find and even provided a fix.  (thanks Doug!)

- Chris Winters <cwinters@intes.net> needed the cache_depth code, so I added it,
  and he was gracious enough to help test it
