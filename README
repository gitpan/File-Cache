NAME

  File::Cache

DESCRIPTION
 
  File::Cache implements an object store where data is persisted
  across processes in the filesystem.  It was written to compliment 
  IPC::Cache.

  Where IPC::Cache is faster for small numbers of simple objects,
  File::Cache tends toward being more performant when caching large
  numbers of complex objects.

REQUIREMENTS

  Storable (optional, if you have Data::Dumper)
  Digest::MD5.

INSTALLATION

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

USAGE

  see perldoc File::Cache

SEE ALSO

  IPC::Cache

NOTES AND CAVEATS

  Use of File::Cache is now discouraged in favor of the new
  Cache::Cache project, also available on CPAN.  Cache::Cache offers
  all of the functionality of File::Cache, as well as integrating
  the functionality of IPC::Cache and a number of new features.  You
  can view the Cache::Cache project page at:

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/perl-cache/



  Version 0.13 breaks old caches.  You will want to remove them when
  upgrading.
